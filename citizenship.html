<p> citizenship- the position or status of being a citizen of a particular country.
  honesty- the quality of being honest.
  compassion- sympathetic pity and concern for the sufferings or misfortunes of others.
  respect- a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements.
  responsibility- the state or fact of having a duty to deal with something or of having control over someone.
  courage- the ability to do something that frightens one.
  being considerate is another component of being a good citizen because you are able to not cause or hurt others and help them get better.
  the most recent act of citizenship I've done is help my friend study for a quiz so he could be more prepared, it was an act of citizenship because it was showing compassion and responsibilty to help my friend study for his quiz.

  I got these definitions from www.dictionary.com
