<p> You decided to drive through the traffic and get there quicker.  While driving through and avoiding the
cars another car turns into your lane, you slam on your brakes but its not enough, you rear-ended the car and
were charged for wreck less driving, and you had to pay for the repairs of the car you crashed into.
You're taken home and your car was taken to a auto shop to get fixed.  You weren't able to go to the race.
The end. </p>
